# Get Together: Dinner Pary Planning App

This is an app for people pleasers who chronically over extend themselves. Get Together helps you to (falsley) appear like you have everything under control.
There are two different ways to use this app. You can either take into account all of your friends various allergies, diets and preferences and create a carfelly crafted menu using out "Menu Planner." Otherwise, "Rogue Mode" allows you to ignore all of that criteria and choose random courses. 

Have Fun!
